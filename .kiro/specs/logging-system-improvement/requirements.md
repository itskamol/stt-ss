# Logging System Improvement - Requirements Document

## Introduction

Hozirgi logging tizimi asosiy funksiyalarni bajaradi, lekin production environment uchun maintainable, scalable va monitoring-friendly bo'lishi kerak. Bu loyihada logging tizimini enterprise-level ga yetkazish maqsad qilingan.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Structured Logging Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent structured logging across all modules, so that I can easily search and analyze logs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any module logs information THEN the system SHALL use standardized log format with consistent metadata fields
2. WHEN logging occurs THEN the system SHALL include correlationId, userId, organizationId, module, timestamp, and level in every log entry
3. WHEN error logging occurs THEN the system SHALL include stack trace, error code, and context information
4. WHEN API requests are logged THEN the system SHALL include method, url, statusCode, responseTime, and user context
5. IF sensitive data is present THEN the system SHALL automatically redact passwords, tokens, and PII information

### Requirement 2: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want logging to have minimal performance impact, so that application response times remain optimal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN high-volume logging occurs THEN the system SHALL use asynchronous logging to prevent blocking
2. WHEN log buffers are full THEN the system SHALL implement backpressure handling without losing critical logs
3. WHEN logging to files THEN the system SHALL use buffered writes with configurable flush intervals
4. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement log level filtering to reduce overhead
5. IF logging fails THEN the system SHALL continue operation without crashing

### Requirement 3: Log Management and Rotation

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated log management, so that disk space is efficiently utilized and old logs are properly archived.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN log files reach size limit THEN the system SHALL automatically rotate logs with timestamp-based naming
2. WHEN log retention period expires THEN the system SHALL automatically delete or archive old log files
3. WHEN disk space is low THEN the system SHALL compress older log files to save space
4. WHEN log rotation occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain log continuity without losing entries
5. IF log directory permissions are insufficient THEN the system SHALL log warnings and attempt fallback locations

### Requirement 4: Real-time Monitoring and Alerting

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want real-time log monitoring, so that I can quickly respond to critical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN error rate exceeds threshold THEN the system SHALL send alerts to configured channels (email, Slack, webhook)
2. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL immediately notify administrators
3. WHEN unusual patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL generate anomaly alerts
4. WHEN system health degrades THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information in logs
5. IF monitoring service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue alerts for later delivery

### Requirement 5: Log Aggregation and Search

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized log search capabilities, so that I can troubleshoot issues across multiple services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logs are generated THEN the system SHALL optionally forward logs to external aggregation services (ELK, Splunk)
2. WHEN searching logs THEN the system SHALL provide correlation ID-based request tracing
3. WHEN analyzing logs THEN the system SHALL support filtering by user, organization, module, and time range
4. WHEN exporting logs THEN the system SHALL provide JSON and CSV export formats
5. IF external log service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue local logging without interruption

### Requirement 6: Security and Compliance

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want secure logging practices, so that sensitive information is protected and compliance requirements are met.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging user actions THEN the system SHALL create tamper-evident audit trails
2. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL automatically redact or hash PII information
3. WHEN storing logs THEN the system SHALL encrypt log files at rest if configured
4. WHEN transmitting logs THEN the system SHALL use secure protocols (TLS) for external services
5. IF data retention policies apply THEN the system SHALL automatically purge logs according to compliance requirements

### Requirement 7: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want flexible logging configuration, so that I can adjust logging behavior without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment changes THEN the system SHALL support different log levels per environment (dev, staging, prod)
2. WHEN modules need different logging THEN the system SHALL support per-module log level configuration
3. WHEN log destinations change THEN the system SHALL support multiple output targets (file, console, external services)
4. WHEN configuration updates THEN the system SHALL reload logging configuration without restart
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL use safe defaults and log configuration errors

### Requirement 8: Development and Debugging Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced debugging capabilities, so that I can efficiently troubleshoot issues during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debugging locally THEN the system SHALL provide colorized console output with readable formatting
2. WHEN tracing requests THEN the system SHALL support detailed request/response logging with correlation IDs
3. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL log execution times for critical operations
4. WHEN testing THEN the system SHALL provide mock logging services for unit tests
5. IF debug mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL include additional context like file names and line numbers

### Requirement 9: Metrics and Analytics

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want logging-based metrics, so that I can understand system usage patterns and performance trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL track request counts, response times, and error rates
2. WHEN users perform actions THEN the system SHALL log user activity patterns for analytics
3. WHEN system resources are used THEN the system SHALL log resource utilization metrics
4. WHEN business events occur THEN the system SHALL create structured business event logs
5. IF metrics collection fails THEN the system SHALL continue normal operation without affecting user experience

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust error handling in logging, so that logging failures don't impact application stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN log destination is unavailable THEN the system SHALL implement fallback logging mechanisms
2. WHEN log parsing fails THEN the system SHALL log raw messages with error indicators
3. WHEN circular logging references occur THEN the system SHALL detect and prevent infinite loops
4. WHEN memory limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation
5. IF logging service crashes THEN the system SHALL automatically restart logging with minimal data loss
